I am a PhD student at the Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Science, Liverpool John Moores University, UK. My research focuses on developing
frameworks for building digital twins for athletes using machine learning, wearable technology and computer simulation to monitor musculoskeletal
loads in the field.
