## Hi there!
<br>
I'm Zhenyuan(Clay) Zhang, a PhD student studying a variety of aspects of human movement biomechanics including performance enhancement, sport injury prevention, sport footwear, wearble technologies and musculoskeletal modelling.

## My academic journey
<br>
In my high school days, I used to be a "sneakerhead" and palyed basketball quite a lot but suffering from sport injuries at the same time. It consequently sparked me to think about what's the mechanics of these injuries and waht can I do to prevent/treat them. Therefore, I chose the Human Movement Science major for my Bachelor's degree at Chengdu Sport University, China (where I gained fond memories of 4 years). After that, I went to the UK and continued my academic career stuying Sport and Clinical Biomechanics for my Master of Science degree at LJMU. During my MSc, I was trained by a lot of nice and knowledgable faculty staff at the Biomechanics Research Laboratory. At present, I'm working hard to get my PhD degree at the same lab. So, stay tuned for the news of my PhD project!
