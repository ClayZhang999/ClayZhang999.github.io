### Sport footwear testing:
1.During my research assistant role under the supervision of Prof. Mark Lake, I have been able to conduct some biomechanical testing for running footwear in collaboration with New Balance Athletics, USA.

2.Right after the running footwear testing, we received another batch of soccer boots to test for New Balance Athletics, USA. This time, my supervisor and I built a mini soccer pitch with artificial turf in our biomechanics lab in the summer of 2021. Trust me! It was a heavy construction job which made me want to bring biomechanical research from labs to the field in the future (exactly what I'm doing for my PhD project now).
